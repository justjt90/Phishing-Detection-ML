						<h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
						<p>Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive
							information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details
							(and money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a
							trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.The word is a
							neologism created as a homophone of fishing due to the similarity
							of using a bait in an attempt to catch a victim. According to the
							2013 Microsoft Computing Safety Index, released in February 2014,
							the annual worldwide impact of phishing could be as high as US$5
							billion.</p>
						<p>Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or
							instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter personal
							information at a fake website, the look and feel of which are
							identical to the legitimate site, the only difference being the
							URL of the website in concern. Communications purporting to be
							from social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment
							processors or IT administrators are often used to lure victims.
							Phishing emails may contain links to websites that distribute
							malware.</p>
						<p>Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques
							used to deceive users, and exploits weaknesses in current web
							security. Attempts to deal with the growing number of reported
							phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public
							awareness, and technical security measures.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>﻿Types of phishing</h2>
						<p>Numerous different types of phishing attacks have now been
							identified. Some of the more prevalent are listed below.</p>

						<h3>Spear phishing</h3>
						<p>Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or
							companies have been termed spear phishing. Attackers may gather
							personal information about their target to increase their
							probability of success. This technique is by far the most
							successful on the Internet today, accounting for 91% of attacks.
							Threat Group-4127 used spear phishing tactics to target email
							accounts linked to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.
							They attacked more than 1,800 Google accounts and implemented the
							accounts-google.com domain to threaten targeted users.</p>
						<h3>Clone phishing</h3>
						<p>Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a
							legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an
							attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es)
							taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email. The
							attachment or link within the email is replaced with a malicious
							version and then sent from an email address spoofed to appear to
							come from the original sender. It may claim to be a resend of the
							original or an updated version to the original. This technique
							could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected
							machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the
							social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both
							parties receiving the original email.</p>
						<h3>Whaling</h3>
						<p>Several phishing attacks have been directed specifically at
							senior executives and other high-profile targets within
							businesses, and the term whaling has been coined for these kinds
							of attacks.In the case of whaling, the masquerading web
							page/email will take a more serious executive-level form. The
							content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the
							person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack
							email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint,
							or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to
							masquerade as a critical business email, sent from a legitimate
							business authority. The content is meant to be tailored for upper
							management, and usually involves some kind of falsified
							company-wide concern. Whaling phishers have also forged
							official-looking FBI subpoena emails, and claimed that the
							manager needs to click a link and install special software to
							view the subpoena.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Link manipulation</h2>
						<p>Most methods of phishing use some form of technical
							deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed
							website it leads to) appear to belong to the spoofed
							organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common
							tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL,
							http://www.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL
							will take you to the example section of the yourbank website;
							actually this URL points to the "yourbank" (i.e. phishing)
							section of the example website. Another common trick is to make
							the displayed text for a link (the text between the "A" tags
							closed with <> brackets) suggest a reliable destination, when the
							link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email
							clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the
							status bar while hovering the mouse over it. This behavior,
							however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the phisher.
							Equivalent mobile apps generally do not have this preview
							feature.</p>
						<p>A further problem with URLs has been found in the handling
							of internationalized domain names (IDN) in web browsers, that
							might allow visually identical web addresses to lead to
							different, possibly malicious, websites. Despite the publicity
							surrounding the flaw, known as IDN spoofing or homograph attack,
							phishers have taken advantage of a similar risk, using open URL
							redirectors on the websites of trusted organizations to disguise
							malicious URLs with a trusted domain.Even digital certificates do
							not solve this problem because it is quite possible for a phisher
							to purchase a valid certificate and subsequently change content
							to spoof a genuine website, or, to host the phish site without
							SSL at all.</p>

						<br />
						<h2>Filter evasion</h2>
						<p>Phishers have even started using images instead of text to
							make it harder for anti-phishing filters to detect text commonly
							used in phishing emails.[22] However, this has led to the
							evolution of more sophisticated anti-phishing filters that are
							able to recover hidden text in images. These filters use OCR
							(optical character recognition) to optically scan the image and
							filter it.</p>
						<p>Some anti-phishing filters have even used IWR (intelligent
							word recognition), which is not meant to completely replace OCR,
							but these filters can even detect cursive, hand-written, rotated
							(including upside-down text), or distorted (such as made wavy,
							stretched vertically or laterally, or in different directions)
							text, as well as text on coloured backgrounds.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Website forgery</h2>
						<p>Once a victim visits the phishing website, the deception is
							not over. Some phishing scams use JavaScript commands in order to
							alter the address bar. This is done either by placing a picture
							of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the
							original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.</p>
						<p>An attacker can even use flaws in a trusted website's own
							scripts against the victim. These types of attacks (known as
							cross-site scripting) are particularly problematic, because they
							direct the user to sign in at their bank or service's own web
							page, where everything from the web address to the security
							certificates appears correct. In reality, the link to the website
							is crafted to carry out the attack, making it very difficult to
							spot without specialist knowledge. Just such a flaw was used in
							2006 against PayPal.</p>
						<p>A Universal Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Phishing Kit,
							discovered in 2007, provides a simple-to-use interface that
							allows a phisher to convincingly reproduce websites and capture
							log-in details entered at the fake site.</p>
						<p>To avoid anti-phishing techniques that scan websites for
							phishing-related text, phishers have begun to use Flash-based
							websites (a technique known as phlashing). These look much like
							the real website, but hide the text in a multimedia object.</p>

						<h2>Covert redirect</h2>
						<p>Covert redirect is a subtle method to perform phishing
							attacks that makes links appear legitimate, but actually redirect
							a victim to an attacker's website. The flaw is usually
							masqueraded under a log-in popup based on an affected site's
							domain. It can affect OAuth 2.0 and OpenID based on well-known
							exploit parameters as well. This often makes use of open redirect
							and XSS vulnerabilities in the third-party application websites.
							Browshing is another way of redirecting users to phishing
							websites covertly through malicious browser extensions.</p>
						<p>Normal phishing attempts can be easy to spot because the
							malicious page's URL will usually be different from the real site
							link. For covert redirect, an attacker could use a real website
							instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login popup
							dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.</p>
						<p>For example, suppose a victim clicks a malicious phishing
							link beginning with Facebook. A popup window from Facebook will
							ask whether the victim would like to authorize the app. If the
							victim chooses to authorize the app, a "token" will be sent to
							the attacker and the victim's personal sensitive information
							could be exposed. These information may include the email
							address, birth date, contacts, and work history. In case the
							"token” has greater privilege, the attacker could obtain more
							sensitive information including the mailbox, online presence, and
							friends list. Worse still, the attacker may possibly control and
							operate the user’s account. Even if the victim does not choose to
							authorize the app, he or she will still get redirected to a
							website controlled by the attacker. This could potentially
							further compromise the victim.</p>
						<p>This vulnerability was discovered by Wang Jing, a
							Mathematics Ph.D. student at School of Physical and Mathematical
							Sciences in Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Covert
							redirect is a notable security flaw, though it is not a threat to
							the Internet worth significant attention.</p>
